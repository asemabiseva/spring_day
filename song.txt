Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had ya eyes wide open, uh, why were they open?

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain (Ooh)
Take a bullet straight through my brain (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Yes, I would die for you, baby (Ooh)
But you won't do the same
